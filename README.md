A Customer Segmentation Project for a Food Delivery Company
This project was conducted as a consultancy analysis for ABCDEats Inc. (ABCDE), a fictional food delivery service operating in three cities. The company partners with a wide range of restaurants to deliver diverse meal options. The goal of this project is to analyze three months of customer data and help ABCDEats develop a data-driven segmentation strategy tailored to different customer types.
By leveraging this segmentation, ABCDEats aims to refine its marketing, retention, and personalization strategies, ensuring better customer engagement and improved business performance.
**Objectives**
- Analyze customer behavior and demographics across three cities.
- Identify key patterns and trends in customer ordering habits.
- Segment customers using multiple perspectives, including:
- Value-based segmentation (e.g., total spend, order frequency)
- Behavioral segmentation (e.g., cuisine preferences, order time)
- Demographic segmentation (e.g., age, gender, income)
- Integrate these segmentations into a final unified model.
- Provide actionable insights to guide ABCDEats' marketing strategy.
