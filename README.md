This project focuses on segmenting customers of ABCDEatsInc., a food delivery company, to improve its marketing strategies and better understand customer behavior. Several clustering methods were tested, including K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, Mean Shift, BIRCH, and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). Before running these models, the data was carefully prepared by handling missing values, removing outliers, and adjusting skewed distributions. After comparing the results of all models, the Self-Organizing Map method was chosen for its ability to clearly group customers into four meaningful segments. Each group was then analyzed based on their spending habits, favorite cuisines, order times, locations, and use of promotions. Based on this analysis, the report proposes targeted marketing actions for each groupâ€”such as re-engaging high-value inactive users, encouraging more frequent spending, and retaining loyal customers through special offers and rewards.
